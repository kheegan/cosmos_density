Analysis and visualization of high-redshift COSMOS density field

Viz_Density.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook for the initial visualization of the COSMOS density field, using mayavi/x3d (it doesn't show properly in GitHub). This allows one to pan, rotate and zoom around the density field within the notebook but requires mayavi to work.

To play around with it, clone it and then install mayavi: https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/installation.html
